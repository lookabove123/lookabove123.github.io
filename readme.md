# Look Above!

## Introduction

This is our entry for HackDavis 2022: Look Above. Our project is aimed at spreading awareness about light pollution. The project cycles through different atmospheric light conditions, which sometimes causes the stars to be blocked out of the sky.  This project allows you to view the star patterns at any time of the year at the Memorial Union. Users are able to see positions of stars in the night sky as the visualization progresses. This visualization is meant to inspire viewers to research about light pollution, and instill wonder!

## Technical Details

Our visualization makes use of Google Maps panoramic images and star data in order to bring the best experience to the viewer. This project makes use of the astronomy database of https://heavens-above.com, through its interactive sky chart utility. We chose three.js to render our images on the webpage.

## Future Steps

While we're happy with the state of the current project, we would make some improvements to the final product if we had more time. These include:
- Higher resolution stars
- More locations to view stars from
